Its design was mostly complete by mid-1995 and launch was delayed until 1996 for the completion of the launch games Super Mario 64, Pilotwings 64, and Saikyō Habu Shōgi (exclusive to Japan).

It was succeeded by the Wii; the first model launched in November 2006 with full backward compatibility with GameCube games and accessories. Retrospective reception of the GameCube has been positive, emphasizing its excellent library; by early 2023, the two highest rated games of the year were both GameCube games, which caused a widescale reassessment of the console's legacy, recontextualizing it in a more positive light.";
